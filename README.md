# Build to publish to Github Pages
`ng build --output-path docs --base-href https://herus02.github.io/angular-products-list-api/`
Move the static files to `docs` and add a screenshot with a filename `img/example.png`
Then, configure Github Pages to host files and deploy from a branch and `/docs/` directory.

## Cloning and running local

Just follow those command lines we usually run: 
`npm install` 
`npm start`
